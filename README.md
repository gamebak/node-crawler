# node-crawler
Nodejs web crawler functional for a single domain call

What can be improved:
1. hash tables for efficient indexing
2. paralell crawling with multiple downloads in the same thread and multithreading to scale on each core with cluster module
3. reduce indexed links length by removing main domain from internal links
